# React + TypeScript + Vite Templates

These are project templates that are used for starting a new Brightlayer UI project. The templates are configured with the basic Brightlayer UI libraries for themes and components and configures the application to use them.

## Available Templates

### Blank

The [Blank template](https://github.com/etn-ccis/blui-react-cli-templates/blob/master/templates/blank-typescript/README.md) provides a bare-bones application with Brightlayer UI components and themes automatically configured and ready to use.

### Routing

The [Routing template](https://github.com/etn-ccis/blui-react-cli-templates/blob/master/templates/routing-typescript/README.md) provides all of the essential Brightlayer UI configuration as well as additional configuration for using using [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/). It also adds a navigation Drawer to switch between several sample screens.

### Authentication

The [Authentication template](https://github.com/etn-ccis/blui-react-cli-templates/blob/master/templates/authentication-typescript/README.md) includes everything from the Routing template and also installs and configures the Brightlayer UI [react-auth-workflow](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@brightlayer-ui/react-auth-workflow) package to automatically wrap the main application with functions and screens for Okta Login, Registration, Change Password, etc.
